    <h2>Provide Sponsorship</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">Denver Dev Day is free, open to the public, and packed with 
    practical training and information on software development. We anticipate around 
    200&nbsp;attendees from our local and national communities. Denver Dev Day will have several 
    tracks with various professional speakers and respected, community leaders. It will be 
    held on at the Microsoft Offices in the Denver Technology Center, a campus that is 
    friends with the developer community.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">The success of Denver Dev Day is, in part, due to our sponsors. 
    For a cash or in-kind donation, your company or group can enjoy excellent exposure to 
    a segment of your target audience. We take it seriously to give your organization the 
    exposure you deserve in front of the best, local audience anyone could muster.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Denver Dev Day cash sponsorship is handled via PayPal. For more 
    information, please contact Daren May, the Denver Dev Day sponsorship manager at
    <a href="mailto:sponsors@denverdevday.com">sponsors@denverdevday.com</a> Please note that 
    Denver Dev Day is not a not-for-profit. As a result, we cannot provide your organization 
    with a tax-related receipt. We can, however, provide a standard receipt and our gratitude.</p>
